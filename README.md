# TikTok-Claims-Analysis-Project-Preparing-Data-for-Content-Moderation-Models-Using-Python

# THIS PROJECT IS IN PROGRESS

📌 Project Overview

This project simulates work performed as a data professional at TikTok, supporting the development of a predictive model that classifies whether a video contains a factual claim or an opinion.

TikTok users submit large volumes of reports identifying content that may require moderator review. Due to scale, TikTok is exploring data-driven solutions to prioritize reports and reduce moderation backlog.

This phase of the project focuses on understanding and preparing the data before advanced modeling.
